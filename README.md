# Data visualisation

- Mode: Solo
- Type: consolidation challenge
- Duration: 5 days

## Objectives

This consolidation challenge will help you assess your ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using your new javascript muscles involving the following know-hows :

- DOM manipulation
- AJAX/FETCH request
- Using Third-party libraries
- problem-solving : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
- Debugging using the console
- Understand the notion of "separation of concerns"

## Your mission

You work in the Multimedia department of one of the European Union institutions. This morning, Johnny Hasnoclew, your Project Manager, sends you on a mission: one of the in-house journalists has published a new article on the institution's website. 

He asks you to make it more rich, more interactive, more... sexy (The use of that specific adjective indicates that Johnny certainly worked in advertising before, the poor guy).

That's exactly what you're going to do, by adding two interactive data visualisation graphics using javascript. These graphs will be interactive in the sense that the user can manipulate the graph, such as filtering data, or reveal detailed data when the mouse hovers over it. You are free to design the interaction in your project.

## Constraints

- You can't edit the html file.
- You have the choice of the type of graphics. Considers the most relevant based on the data and what story they can "tell".
- The choice of the javascript library is limited to the 2 libraries offered (there are many others, but these are references and are very popular)
